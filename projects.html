	<h2>Stable Prediction of Defect-Inducing Software Changes (SPDISC)</h2>
	<p> Principal investigator: <a href="index.html">Dr. Leandro L. Minku</a>.<br>
          Keywords: software defect prediction, concept drift,
          ensembles of learning machines.<br>
          Funding: <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R006660/1">Engineering
            and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</a>.<br><br>

	  <b>Context: </b>software systems have become ever
          larger and more complex. This inevitably leads to
          software defects, whose debugging is estimated to cost
          the global economy 312 billion USD annually. Reducing
          the number of software defects is a challenging
          problem, and is particularly important considering the
          strong pressure towards rapid delivery. Such pressure
          impedes different parts of the software source code to
          all receive equally large amount of inspection and
          testing effort. <br>
          <br>
          With that in mind, machine learning approaches have
          been proposed for predicting defect-inducing changes
          in the source code as soon as these changes finish
          being implemented. Such approaches could enable
          software engineers to target special testing and
          inspection attention towards parts of the source code
          most likely to induce defects, reducing the risk of
          committing defective changes. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Problem:</b> the predictive performance of existing
          approaches is unstable, because the underlying defect
          generating process being modelled may vary over time
          (i.e., there may be concept drift). This means that
          practitioners cannot be confident about the prediction
          ability of existing approaches -- at any given point
          in time, predictive models may be performing very well
          or failing dramatically.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Aim and vision:</b> SPDISC aims at creating more
          stable models for predicting defect-inducing changes,
          through the development of a novel machine learning
          approach for automatically adapting to concept drift.
          When integrated with software versioning systems, the
          models will provide early, reliable and automated
          defect-inducing change alerts throughout the lifetime
          of software projects. <br>
          <br>
	  <b>Impact: </b>SPDISC will enable a transformation in
          the way software developers review and commit their
          changes. By creating stable models to make software
          developers aware of defect-inducing changes as soon as
          these are implemented, it will allow targeted
          inspection and testing attention towards
          defect-inducing code throughout the lifetime of
          software projects. This will reduce the debugging cost
          and ultimately lead to better software quality. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Proposed approach: </b>an online learning
          algorithm will be developed to process incoming data
          as they become available, enabling fast reaction to
          concept drift. Concept drift will be detected using
          methods designed to cope with class imbalance, which
          typically occurs in prediction of defect-inducing
          software changes. Class imbalance refers to the issue
          of having a much smaller number of defect-inducing
          changes than the number of safe changes. The proposed
          approach will also make use of data from different
          projects (i.e., transfer learning between domains) to
          speed up adaptation to concept drift. <br>
          <br>
	  <b>Novelty: </b>SPDISC is the first proposal to look
          into the stability of predictive performance over time
          in the context of defect-inducing software changes.
          Most previous work ignored the fact that predictions
          are required over time, being oblivious of the
          instability of predictive performance in this problem.
          To deal with instability, SPDISC will develop the
          first online transfer learning approach for predicting
          defect-inducing software changes. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Ambitiousness: </b>online transfer learning
          between domains with concept drift is not only a very
          new area of research in software engineering, but also
          in machine learning. Very few approaches exist for
          that, and none of them can deal with class-imbalanced
          problems. Therefore, SPDISC will not only advance
          software engineering by enabling a transformation in
          the way software developers review and commit their
          changes, but also advance the area of machine learning
          itself. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Timeliness: </b>given the current size and
          complexity of software systems, the increased number
          of life-critical applications, and the high
          competitiveness of the software industry, approaches
          for improving software quality and reducing the cost
          of producing and maintaining software are currently of
          utmost importance.<br>

          My work on this project completed in August 2015.<br>
          <br>
	  DAASE aims to create a new approach to software
          engineering which places computational search at the
          heart of the process and products it creates and
          embeds adaptivity into both. This new approach will
          produce software that is dynamically adaptive, being
          not only able to respond to and fix problems that
          arise before deployment and during operation, but also
          to continually optimise, re-configure and evolve to
          adapt to new operating conditions, platforms and
          environmental challenges. DAASE will create an array
          of new processes, methods, techniques and tools for
          this new kind of software engineering, radically
          transforming both theory and practice of software
          engineering. As part of it, DAASE will develop a
          hyper-heuristic approach to adaptive automation. A
          hyper-heuristic is a methodology for selecting or
          generating heuristics. Most heuristic methods in the
          literature operate on a search space of potential
          solutions to a particular problem. However, a
          hyper-heuristic operates on a search space of
          heuristics. <br>
          <br>
	  Currently, I am researching into adaptive software
          prediction. Software prediction tasks are of strategic
          importance for software developing companies. An
          example of such task is software effort estimation.
          Overestimations may result in a company loosing
          contracts or wasting resources, whereas
          underestimations may result in poor quality, delayed
          or unfinished software systems. Most software
          prediction research neglects the fact that software
          prediction tasks operate in online changing
          environments. Models are typically trained on a set of
          projects and evaluated on another set of projects,
          without considering whether the training projects were
          really available before the testing projects. Besides
          possibly leading to incorrect conclusions, this
          results in inflexible prediction approaches that
          become obsolete with time. I am currently
          investigating the type of changes suffered by software
          prediction tasks and proposing new approaches to
          quickly adapt to these changes.<br>

        <h2>Online Ensemble Learning in the Presence of Concept Drift</h2>
	<p> Supervisor: <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Exin">Prof. Xin Yao</a>.<br>
          Keywords: concept drift, online learning, ensembles of
          learning machines.<br>

          School Research Studentship (School of Computer
          Science, The University of Birmingham). <br>

          Most machine learning algorithms operate in offline
          mode. They first learn how to perform a certain task,
          and then are used to perform this task. However, most
          practical problems change with time, i.e., they suffer
          concept drift. For example, the problem of predicting
          users' preferences in information filtering systems
          may involve changes in users' preferences; the problem
          of classifying webpages may involve changes in the
          most representative words of different webpage
          categories; the problem of credit card approval may
          involve changes in customers' reliability. Different
          from offline learning algorithms, online learning
          algorithms can be used to adapt to concept drifts
          based on newly incoming training examples. These
          algorithms do not have a separate training and testing
          phase, but learn throughout their lifetime as they are
          used to perform a certain task, by processing each new
          training example separately and then discarding it. <br>
          <br>
          Due to the practical need for adaptive learning
          systems, there has been an increasing number of works
          on online learning algorithms able to deal with
          concept drift. In particular, online ensembles of
          learning machines have been used. However, there has
          been no deep study of why they can be helpful for
          dealing with drifts and which of their features can
          contribute for that. This thesis mainly investigates
          not only how ensemble diversity affects accuracy in
          online learning in the presence of concept drift, but
          also how to use diversity in order to significantly
          improve accuracy in changing environments. This is the
          first diversity study in the presence of concept
          drift. The main contributions of the thesis are:<br>
	  <ul>
            <li><b>A better understanding of when, how and
                why ensembles of learning machines can help to
                handle concept drift in online learning. </b>This
              study shows that one reason for ensembles to be
              helpful for dealing with concept drifts is the
              diversity among their base learners. Diversity is
              even more important in changing environments than
              in static environments. A proper level of
              diversity at each different environmental
              condition can significantly reduce the test errors
              of the learning machines as follows. Before a
              drift, ensembles with less diversity obtain lower
              test errors. On the other hand, it is a good
              strategy to maintain very highly diverse ensembles
              to obtain lower test errors shortly after a drift
              independent of the type of drift, even though high
              diversity is more important for more severe
              drifts. Longer after a drift, high diversity
              becomes less important. High diversity by itself
              can help to reduce the initial increase in error
              caused by a drift, but does not provide faster
              recovery from drifts in the long-term.</li><br>

	    <li><b>Knowledge of how to use information learnt before a concept drift to aid the learning after a concept drift. </b>Previous works have never
              attempted to use information learnt before a concept
              drift to aid the learning after a concept drift.
              However, a good learning machine for changing
              environments should not only avoid using outdated
              information, but also be able to use information
              previously learnt whenever it becomes useful. This
              thesis shows that ensembles trained before a concept
              drift with very high diversity can be used to transfer
              useful information learnt from the old concept to the
              new concept. Information learnt before a concept drift
              is shown to be helpful for the learning process after
              the drift when the drift is slow or does not cause too
              many changes. Very highly diverse ensembles perform
              well in comparison to other strategies after these
              concept drifts as long as low diversity is enforced
              after the concept drift.</li><br>

	    <li> <b>A new online ensemble learning approach called Diversity for Dealing with Drifts (DDD).</b>Based
              on the deep diversity studies summarized above, a new
              approach called DDD was proposed. A good learning
              approach for changing environments should: (i)
              maximize performance when the concept is stable; (ii)
              minimize the drop in performance when there is concept
              drift; (iii) quickly recover from concept drifts; and
              (iv) efficiently use information previously learnt
              whenever it is beneficial. DDD was carefully designed
              to use ensemble diversity for dealing with these
              requirements. It maintains ensembles with different
              levels of diversity which are automatically emphasized
              during environmental states in which they are helpful.
              In this way, DDD is robust to different types of
              concept drift. A study based on both artificial data
              sets and real world data sets in the domains of credit
              card approval, computer network intrusion detection
              and electricity price trend prediction showed that DDD
              was able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches. In
              all the experimental comparisons carried out, DDD
              always performed at least as well as other drift
              handling approaches under various conditions, with
              very few exceptions. Furthermore, DDD was shown to be
              very robust to false positive drift detections,
              outperforming other drift handling approaches in terms
              of accuracy under these conditions.</li><br>

	    <li><b>A new concept drift categorisation to allow principled studies of drifts. </b>The existing
              literature presented very heterogeneous and ambiguous
              categorisations of concept drifts. In this thesis, a
              categorisation using mutually exclusive and
              unambiguous categories was proposed. Drifts are
              categorised according to different criteria in order
              to aid the development and evaluation of approaches to
              deal with concept drifts.</li><br>

            <li><b>An analysis of negative correlation in incremental learning.</b> This thesis also presents
              a study of the suitability of ensembles based on
              negative correlation learning for incrementally
              learning new chunks of training examples under stable
              environments. It shows that even though it is possible
              to use negative correlation learning for that,
              chunk-based incremental learning approaches face a
              difficult trade-off between avoiding catastrophic
              forgetting under periods of stability and attaining
              plasticity when adaptivity to changes is needed.<br></li>

          Evolving Connectionist Systems (ECoSs) are systems
          composed by one or more neural networks whose
          structures adapt according to the data in a continuous
          interaction with the environment. Evolving Fuzzy
          Neural Networks (EFuNNs) are ECoSs which join the
          neural networks functional characteristics to the
          power of fuzzy logic. Fuzzy systems have been showing
          to be very efficient to represent and reason about
          uncertain knowledge. This is very important, as, many
          times, human knowledge is uncertain.<br>
          <br>
	  A key challenge in Artificial Intelligence is to
          create systems that are able not only to represent
          human knowledge and reason about it, but also to
          evolve and adapt their structures in a changing
          environment. This kind of system is able to model
          processes that continually develop and change over
          time, e.g., biological data processing, electricity
          load forecasting and adaptive speech recognition. A
          system with these characteristics needs to be able to
          tune its parameters in an on-line manner, according to
          the environment. EFuNNs have some adaptable parameters
          and their structures can also adapt according to
          incoming data. However, they still have many
          parameters that are fixed before the learning and have
          great influence on its results. The problem of using a
          fixed set of parameters is that an optimal set to a
          particular state of the environment can be unsuitable
          when the state of the environment changes.<br>
          <br>
          In this work, two new techniques which use
          evolutionary algorithms to evolve the EFuNN parameters
          in an on-line manner were developed. These techniques
          are able to create fuzzy systems that are completely
          tunable, according to unpredictable and unknown
          environments. The techniques showed to be able to have
          better accuracy than the techniques existent in the
          literature to evolve EFuNN parameters in an on-line
          manner.<br>

	  Besides the necessity to create new techniques to
          allow changing environments to be represented, it is
          always important to develop approaches with increasing
          generalization capabilities and lower execution time.
          Ensembles of neural networks have formally and
          empirically shown to outperform systems composed by
          only one neural network. Thus, this work also proposes
          a new approach to create ensembles of neural networks,
          e.g., ensembles of EFuNNs. The approach uses a
          clustering method and co-evolutionary algorithms to
          create the ensembles in an innovative way, explicitly
          partitioning the input space, in order to allow the
          networks that compose the ensemble to specialise in
          different parts of it and work in a divide-an-conquer
          manner. The approach showed to be able to improve the
          accuracy of single EFuNNs generated using evolutionary
          algorithms similar to the co-evolutionary algorithms
          used in the approach. Furthermore, the execution time
          of the approach is lower than the execution time of
          evolutionary algorithms to generate single EFuNNs.<br>
